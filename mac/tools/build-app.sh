# Build mac/dist/OpenBoard.app from the SwiftPM executable.
#
# Xcode is not installed here, so there is no xcodebuild and no asset catalog. The
# bundle is assembled by hand — the same approach the Node version used, and it works
# identically for a Swift binary.
#
# Three things carried over from that version because they were learned the hard way:
#
#  - Ad-hoc signing does NOT preserve the TCC grant across rebuilds. An ad-hoc
#    signature has no team identity, so macOS tracks the app by CDHash and a rebuild
#    is a different app as far as Input Monitoring and Accessibility are concerned.
#    Signing is still required — an unsigned bundle is not a valid TCC subject at all
#    — it just is not stable. So this is a no-op when nothing has changed.
#  - Never replace the bundle underneath a running app: it invalidates the live
#    process's signature and it loses its permissions mid-session.
#  - Sign inside out. `codesign` on a bundle seals the *main* executable and the
#    standard nested-code directories; a second binary dropped into Contents/MacOS is
#    not one of those, so openboard-hook kept whatever signature SwiftPM's linker gave
#    it — ad-hoc, no hardened runtime. Locally that is invisible. Notarization rejects
#    it outright, and the error names the file rather than the cause.
#
# Usage: mac/tools/build-app.sh [--force] [--release] [--install] [--universal]
#
# Environment:
#   OB_VERSION    override the marketing version (default: nearest git tag)

#   OB_IDENTITY   codesign identity to use     (default: Developer ID, else the

#   OB_ALLOW_ADHOC=1  with neither of those, sign ad-hoc instead of refusing

#      notarization, and the reason an update can keep its permissions: the designated
#      requirement is the team identity, so v1.4 is the same app as v1.3 to TCC.
#   2. OpenBoard Local Signing  — self-signed, this machine only. Stable enough that
#      grants survive a rebuild. See tools/make-signing-cert.sh.
#   3. ad-hoc                   — valid, but a new app to TCC on every build. Only
#      with OB_ALLOW_ADHOC=1; otherwise the build refuses.
#
# The local rung is searched in the *unfiltered* listing. `security find-identity -v`
# shows only trusted identities, and a self-signed certificate is untrusted, so with -v
# the search never found it, fell through to ad-hoc, and every such build silently
