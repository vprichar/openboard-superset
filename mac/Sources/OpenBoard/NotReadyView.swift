/**
 Stands in for a pane that cannot mean anything yet.

 ## Why replace rather than disable

 Board, Colors and the harness panes all configure how the six keys look and what they
 do. On an install that has not been set up, every one of those settings saves happily
 to disk and changes nothing anybody can see — the pad is not open, so nothing paints.
 The window looked completely functional and was not, which is the worst combination:
 someone picks colours for twenty minutes, sees no result, and concludes the app is
 broken rather than unfinished.

 Greying the controls out would be the smaller change and the wrong one. A disabled
 control says "you may not do this", when the truth is "this will work, and you will not
 be able to tell". The pane is replaced by what to do instead.

 ## Why the Device pane is exempt

 It is the diagnostic surface. Blocking the one place that says which permission is
 missing, on the grounds that a permission is missing, is a locked door with the key
 behind it.

/**
 Wraps a pane so it shows `NotReadyView` until the required setup is done.

 A modifier rather than an `if` inside each pane, because the check has to be identical
 across all of them — three copies of "is this ready" is three chances for one of them
 to disagree, and the one that disagrees is the one that lets you edit a board that
 cannot paint.
