 In-app updates.

 ## Why an updater at all, rather than "download the new one"

 This app holds Input Monitoring and Accessibility grants, and macOS ties both to the
 bundle's path *and* its code signature. Sparkle replaces the bundle in place, under
 the same Developer ID, so the grants survive an update and the user is never sent back
 to System Settings. Dragging a fresh copy over the old one usually works and sometimes
 does not — a `.app` that arrived in Finder is quarantined, and a partially replaced
 bundle is a signature that matches nothing.

 The same argument covers the two other pieces of state that point at the bundle by
 path: the login-item registration, and the `openboard-hook` command written into
 `~/.claude/settings.json`. An in-place update leaves both correct. Anything that moves
 the bundle breaks both silently — the app still launches, and nothing ever lights.

 ## Why it can be off

 `SUPublicEDKey` is empty in a local build, because signing the feed needs a private key
 that lives on one machine. Starting the updater without it produces a check that fails
 every time with a signature error nobody can act on, so the updater simply does not
 start. `isAvailable` is what the UI asks rather than hiding the failure behind a button
 that does nothing.

 ## Why this tracks its own state

 Sparkle drives its own windows, and for the *user-initiated* check that is the whole
 job — you click, a dialog appears. But a background check that quietly finds something
 has nowhere to say so, and this app is a menu bar item with no Dock badge to mark. The
 status published here is what lets the popover mention an update without Sparkle
 needing to interrupt anybody.
