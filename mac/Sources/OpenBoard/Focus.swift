/**
 Raise the window hosting a session.

 Ported from `lib/focus.cjs`, including the mistake it made. Three strategies, chosen by
 how the session runs:

 - **Terminal or iTerm2: exact.** Both apps' AppleScript dictionaries expose `tty` —
   Terminal per tab, iTerm2 per session — and a CLI session's process owns a tty, so
   the precise tab (or session) can be selected. A session known to be in iTerm2 goes
   straight there; one whose host could not be resolved tries Terminal first and then
   iTerm2, since an exact-match miss cannot mis-raise anything.
 - **cmux: exact, and not by tty.** cmux has no AppleScript and its surfaces expose no
   tty, so the tty branch cannot reach one — it would select nothing and, before
   `origin` knew about cmux, fell through to opening the folder in an editor. Its own
   socket addresses a surface by id instead, which is exact and needs no Automation
   grant. See `Cmux`.
 - **Superset: by workspace deep link.** A session whose hook carried
   `SUPERSET_WORKSPACE_ID` opens `superset://v2-workspace/<id>`, which selects the
   workspace and brings Superset forward. Workspace-exact, not pane-exact: Superset has
   no known link to a specific terminal.
 - **VS Code: approximate.** An extension-hosted session has no tty, so the window for
   the workspace folder is raised. That focuses the right window, not the specific
   Claude panel inside it — an honest limit rather than a bug to chase.

 **A `cli` session with no tty gets nothing.** That is a detached background job: it
 was never hosted in a window, so there is nothing to raise. The earlier version read
 "no tty" as evidence of VS Code and opened the project as a *folder* in an editor
 unrelated to the session — a confident wrong answer to "jump to that chat", which is
 worse than admitting there is nowhere to go.

 Needs Automation permission for Terminal and, separately, for iTerm2. Granted per
 app, and only after a restart.

         could not get there. It now asks `origin`, which knows who owns the process.

    /**
     Reveal the tab holding one specific conversation.

     The Claude Code extension registers a URI handler, and `/open?session=` routes
     through `claude-vscode.primaryEditor.open` to a panel map keyed by session id: an
     id already on screen is `reveal()`ed rather than reopened. So the exact chat is
     reachable from outside VS Code, which no public API offers — the extension's own
     commands are the only thing that knows which panel is which.

     **Only for extension-hosted sessions.** A session in VS Code's integrated terminal
     is also `origin == .vscode` and has no panel, so this would miss the map and *create*
     one — a second, resumed view of a conversation that is already running in a terminal
     three feet away. That is the class of confident wrong answer this file exists to
     avoid, so the caller gates on the entry point rather than on the origin.

     A closed panel is reopened rather than revealed, which is the same thing the user
     asked for: the board only lists live sessions, so the conversation is still running.

     Undocumented, and therefore treated like the rest of this app's private
     dependencies: if the handoff fails, fall back to raising the app rather than
     leaving the press with nothing to show for it.
