/**
 The window guided setup lives in.

 Its own window rather than a sheet on the settings window, because the popover offers
 setup at a moment when the settings window does not exist — and opening a whole control
 panel in order to hang a sheet on it is a great deal of furniture for four checkboxes.

 Small, non-resizable, and centred. There is one column of content and no reason to drag
 it wider; a resizable window here only offers people the chance to make it look wrong.

 The activation policy dance matches MainWindowController's. An `.accessory` app cannot
 bring a window properly forward — it opens behind whatever is frontmost, which for a
 window someone just asked for reads as the click having been ignored.
