/**
 The app.

 `MenuBarExtra` with `.menuBarExtraStyle(.window)` gives the popover the design calls
 for — a real panel with rows, sections and buttons — rather than an NSMenu, which
 could not draw LED dots or a keycap grid.

 No Dock icon while it is just watching: this is an ambient status tool, and a Dock
 icon for one is noise. The settings window raises the app to `.regular` while it is
 open — an accessory app cannot take full screen or own a menu bar — and it drops back
 on close.

 The settings window is **not** a SwiftUI `Settings` scene. That scene could not go
 full screen, did not appear in the window list or the app switcher, and was not in
 `NSApp.windows` even while open, so nothing in the app could find or raise it. See
 `MainWindowController`.

     Whether the status item is in the menu bar.

     Without this binding, `MenuBarExtra` gives its status item
     `.terminationOnRemoval`: the moment the item leaves the menu bar — ⌘-dragged off,
     or hidden by macOS 26's menu bar management — the app quits. AppKit then records
     the item as not visible, restores it hidden on the next launch, and SwiftUI quits
     again about a second in, with nothing in the log and no crash report. The app
     could not be opened at all until `NSStatusItem Visible…` was cleared by hand, and
     even that did not hold once Control Center was the one hiding it.

     With the binding, removal flips this to false instead of quitting, and starting at
     `true` re-inserts the item on every launch. The pad, the hooks and the socket keep
     running either way — the icon is the app's shadow, not the app.
