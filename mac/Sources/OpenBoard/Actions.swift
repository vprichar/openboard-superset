    /**
     Is the thing in front of us the session we asked for?

     Both surfaces answer this, by different means, and the third case answers *no* on
     purpose:

     - **Terminal or iTerm2** compares the frontmost tab's (or session's) tty. Exact.
       `SlotView` does not say which of the two hosts the session — `Focus.raise` does
       not need to know either, per its own tty-exact-match fallback — so this asks
       Terminal first and, if that does not match, iTerm2. Each is only asked if it is
       already running: guarded the same way `Focus.focusTerminal`/`focusITerm2` are,
       so polling this during `confirmFrontmost`'s retry loop cannot launch an app the
       session was never hosted in.
     - **cmux** requires two things: that cmux is the frontmost *application*, which is
       what decides where the keystroke goes, and that the surface cmux has focused
       within itself is this session's. Exact, and the only branch that needs no
       Automation grant to answer. A session whose surface cannot be resolved answers
       *no* rather than assuming — same rule as the integrated-terminal case below, for
       the same reason.
     - **VS Code, extension-hosted** compares the focused window's title against the
       session's name. The extension names its tab after the session, so a revealed chat
       puts its name in the window title — see `VSCodeWindows`.
     - **A session in VS Code's integrated terminal** cannot be confirmed at all. The pty
       is not Terminal's, and no window title names it. Rather than assume the raise
       landed and fire ⏎ into whatever is in front, this reports a failure — the whole
       reason the check exists.

             That is the precise misdelivery this whole check exists to prevent, and it
             is why the Terminal branch asks `frontmost of window w` rather than just
