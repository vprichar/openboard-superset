/**
 The menu bar popover.

 Section order is the design's, and it is an order of urgency: what the pad is doing,
 then anything blocked on you, then the six sessions, then the action keys, then the
 commands. 376pt wide and internally scrollable so a long chat title never widens it.

 When the pad is unusable a banner says so above the sessions, which stay. The list
 used to be replaced entirely on the grounds that a board you cannot trust is worse
 than no board — but the sessions are not the board: they come from hooks and the
 process table, jumping to one is AppleScript or the cmux socket, and none of that
 needs the pad. Only the lights do, and the banner owns that fact.

     you time right now; a new version is not. Putting them in the same place would
     teach you to skim past the one that matters.

     It also deliberately does not borrow the pad's colours. Orange, green, blue and red
     mean specific *session* states on the hardware and in this window, and an app update
     is not a session state — a green update row would read as "a chat finished" to
     anyone who has learned the board. So it takes the neutral control treatment and
     earns attention by being absent the rest of the time.

     The action keys, laid out as they physically are.

     Previously a three-column grid in reading order, which put ACT09 underneath ACT06
     and stood the double-width MIC cap up as an ordinary square. Neither matches the
     object under your hand: on the pad, ACT06–ACT09 are one row of four, and the
     bottom row is the touch strip, a 2U cap, and one more key.

     So this renders `BoardLayout.rows`' last two rows through the same `BoardCapView`
     the settings window draws the pad with — same 51pt caps, same 2U geometry, same
     materials. Reaching for a key in the menu should be the same spatial act as
     reaching for it on the desk, and two different pictures of one keyboard is a
     memory tax for no benefit.

     `Grid`, not `LazyVGrid`: only `Grid` honours `gridCellColumns`, and without it the
     wide cap silently collapses and the row comes out a column short.

     ## The touch strip is a hole, not a key

     It is drawn on the pad in the settings window because it is physically there, and
     the window is a picture of the object. Here it was a black disc labelled "inert" —
     a control offering nothing, in a menu whose every other item does something.

     It is left out, but **its column is not**. An empty cell of the same width keeps
     the 2U cap in the position your hand knows; deleting the cell outright slides the
     whole bottom row one key to the left and the picture stops being true.
