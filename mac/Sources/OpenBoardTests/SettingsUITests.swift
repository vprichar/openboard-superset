 whether iTerm2 is installed, but it only ever changes what a rendered row *says* — the
 row itself still rendered unconditionally before this guard, which is exactly the
 "demand permission for an app that is not installed" failure the design forbids.

 A control that changes nothing.

 `BoardModel` is the display copy. Writing to it redraws the settings window and does
 nothing else — it does not save, and it does not push the change into the dispatcher
 that reads a binding when a key is actually pressed. `commands.bindingsChanged()` is
 what does both.

 The whole Board pane was missing it: keycap, action, snippet, joystick direction,
 encoder click, hold time and scroll size all appeared to take, then vanished on
 restart, and never took effect on the pad in between. The notification-state picker
 and the fun-mode gain slider had the same gap.

 This is the same shape as every other bug in this project's history — correct code
 that nothing called — and no test of the settings *logic* can catch it, because the
 logic is right and the wiring is absent. So this reads the source.
