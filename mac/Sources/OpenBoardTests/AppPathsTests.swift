 stop updating for reasons no one can see.

 Which physical key is slot 1.

 to enforce it, because of one fact that only turned up when the evidence was gathered.

 **Every mapping either implementation has ever produced is identity.** The Node
 version's `calibrate --rows` wrote `identityMapping()` *regardless of what the operator
 reported*, so no other mapping has ever existed on any pad. The gate charged every new
 user a dark board and six dropdowns to write down an answer already known.

 So identity is the default, and what remains guarded is the part that could still lie:
