 The wire format, checked against the Node implementation.

 This protocol is undocumented and reverse-engineered. There is no spec to consult and
 no error when it is wrong — a malformed report is silently dropped by the firmware
 and the key simply does not light. So the framing is pinned by value here, and the
 fixtures are what `lib/hid.cjs` actually produces.
