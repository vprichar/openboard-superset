/**
 The joystick, decoded from the stream everyone thought was empty.

 The angles below are from a real 30-second capture: pushing each direction produced a
 tight cluster at 0.005, 0.234, 0.495 and 0.775 — evenly spaced quarter turns, with
 opposite directions exactly half a turn apart. Rolling it round the rim swept the
 angle continuously through everything between.
