 iTerm2 as a named host, and the per-surface listening switches.

 These two arrived together for one reason: a switch can only exist for a surface the
 board can *identify*. Jumping to iTerm2 has worked for a while — the tty walk falls
 through to it after Terminal misses — but nothing knew a session was *in* iTerm2, so
 there was no row to put a switch beside and no host to match a mute against.
