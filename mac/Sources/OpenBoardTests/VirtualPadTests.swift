 The pad with no hardware behind it: that the bytes a repaint writes decode back to
 what was meant, that every message is acknowledged the way the firmware does it, and
 that a virtual key press is indistinguishable from a real one to the parser.

 The decoder is also the first test the *encoder* has ever had beyond byte-diffing:
 until now nothing in the suite could say what a prepared batch meant.
