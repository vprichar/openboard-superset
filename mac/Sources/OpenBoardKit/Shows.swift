/**
 Ring animations.

 Ported from `lib/shows.cjs` with the timings intact, because the timings *are* the
 design. Two things learned there that a rewrite would otherwise undo:

 - **Each step is asserted once and then left alone.** The firmware runs the animation
   itself; re-sending the same config restarts it from the beginning, which is what
   made a 4s snake look like flashing instead of one smooth lap.
 - **Speed decides how many laps fit in the window**, so the snake speeds are
   deliberately low. At 0.6 the snake lapped several times and read as a strobe.

 Because a single write has to survive for the length of a step, the board's
 re-assertion has to leave the ring alone while one plays — see `ringLockedUntil`.

     total time is both smoother and quicker.
