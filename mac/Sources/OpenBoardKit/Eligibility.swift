/**
 Decides whether a Claude Code session may consume one of the six Agent keys.

 Ported from `lib/eligibility.cjs` rule for rule, including the order the checks run
 in — a subagent belonging to an embedded SDK client should report as a subagent,
 because that is the more specific and more useful answer.

 **Fail-closed by design.** An unrecognised surface gets no light rather than
 quietly stealing one. Six keys is a scarce budget and it belongs to sessions a human
 is actually sitting in front of. The failure mode being avoided is real and was
 observed: ten `claude` processes under an unrelated VS Code extension, all running
 with `--setting-sources=user` so user-level hooks fired for every one of them. Without
 the allowlist they would have taken all six keys before a human session appeared.

 Every value here was observed from real sessions rather than taken from a schema.
