/**
 Which session owns which of the six keys.

 Ported from `lib/registry.cjs`, rule for rule. Deliberately a value type with pure
 transitions: every decision here is testable without a device, a session, or a clock,
 and each of these rules exists because of a specific way the board once lied.

 **Ephemeral by design.** Nothing is persisted. The registry is rebuilt from hooks, so
 "Forget all sessions" is simply emptying it — and a stale entry can never outlive a
 restart, which is what the Node version's on-disk registry allowed.

     Age transient states back to rest.

     ## `done` does not expire by default

     Green means *this finished and you have not been back yet*. It is cleared by
     returning to the session and sending something — `UserPromptSubmit` moves it to
     `working` — not by a timer.

     An earlier version aged it out after 90s on the reasoning that green stops meaning
     anything if it is permanent. That reasoning was wrong about which failure costs
     more: a session that finished while you were elsewhere is exactly the one you need
     to be told about, and a timer means the board quietly forgets it before you look.
     The result was finished work becoming invisible, which is the opposite of the job.
     Six keys is a small enough board that "several are green" is information, not noise.

     Set `doneDecaySeconds` above zero to bring the timer back.

     `awaiting` is held by default and expires only when asked to. The hooks already
     clear it the moment the prompt is answered — `PostToolUse` arriving *is* the answer
     — so the timer was a safety net for a prompt answered somewhere OpenBoard cannot
     see. That is rare enough to be a choice rather than a permanent quiet deadline, and
     it was expressed as a duration in minutes, which is the wrong question to ask
     someone: nobody knows how long they want to wait for a thing that should not happen.

     `holdAttention: false` brings the net back, at a fixed 15 minutes. There is no

     `idle_prompt` fires on an idle *timer* (Claude Code's own ~60s "still there?"
     check), not a real user-idle signal — the same reason `defaultNotifications`
     deliberately omits it above. Left unmapped in a fresh config it is harmless, but a

     demotion: it fires well inside a delegating session's `.working` window and, since
     `mayReplace` only guards `done -> idle`, repaints a delegating key straight to
     slate with no warning.

     Keyed on the **subtype**, not the mapped state, because the remap is
     user-controlled — suppressing only when the mapped state happens to equal `.idle`
     would miss a user who remapped `idle_prompt` to some other color, and the false
     signal is the subtype firing at all, not which color it happened to land on this
     machine.

     Scoped to `idle_prompt` alone: `permission_prompt`/`agent_needs_input`/
