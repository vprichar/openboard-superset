/**
 Where Claude Code's hooks report to.

 A Unix domain socket at `~/.claude/openboard/hook.sock`, one JSON object per
 connection. Chosen over a TCP port for three reasons that all matter here: it cannot
 be reached from off-host at all (the Node version needed an explicit non-local `Host`
 rejection to get the same property), it is protected by ordinary filesystem
 permissions, and it cannot collide with whatever else is listening on 4455.

 ## Why the hooks do not talk to this directly

 A Claude Code hook is a shell command. It cannot open a socket on its own, so a tiny
 helper still stands between them — but the helper does nothing except forward stdin
 and exit, which means `hooks/install.cjs` only ever needs its target path changed.

 That indirection buys something real: hooks run *inline with the session*, so
 anything slow or wedged there is felt by the user as a stalled prompt. A helper that
 writes to a socket and exits cannot block on device I/O, a write lock, or a pad that
 has gone to sleep. The Node version ran the whole registry update and a device
 repaint inside the hook.

 ## Fail-open, always

 Every path here is best-effort. A status light must never be able to break a
 session — if the app is not running, the socket is not there, or the payload is
 malformed, the helper exits 0 and the session carries on unaware.
