/**
 The six-plus-two state vocabulary the whole product is built on.

 Ported verbatim from `lib/config.cjs`. The colors are **hardware** colors: they
 are what the LED is told to emit, not a theme. They must never be restyled to match
 a window's appearance — a swatch in the settings window and the key on the pad are
 the same value, and the moment they diverge the window is lying about the device.

 Two rules from the design brief survive here as invariants rather than prose:

 - Orange belongs to `awaiting` alone. It is the only color that means *act now*,
   and nothing else may compete for that register.
 - `idle` must not be near-white. The pad's own resting state is white, so a white
   key is indistinguishable from an unlit one — and most sessions sit at idle most
   of the time.

    /**
     Whether a new state is allowed to replace the current one.

     Almost always yes. The exception is **`idle` must not overwrite `done`**, because
     `done` already means idle *and* carries something you have not seen yet — that a
     turn finished while you were elsewhere.

     This is not hypothetical. Claude Code fires an `idle_prompt` notification about 60
     seconds after a turn ends, and a configuration that maps that to `idle` repaints
     straight over the green:

         17:59:15  Stop         -> done
         18:00:15  Notification -> idle

     Which looked exactly like a decay timer that had been switched off but was somehow
     still running. It was a hook, arriving on a schedule, doing what it was told.

     Handled here rather than by unmapping `idle_prompt` in one machine's config: any
     mapping that resolves to `idle` has the same effect, and the rule that a completion
     survives until you go back to it should not depend on a notification's wiring.

     one you notice is a finished session: green, solid, and indistinguishable from a
     green key across the board.

     So focus adds **motion**, never a color. A finished-and-focused key is still green
     — it has to be, because green is the thing you came back for — it just moves more,

     "More" depends on where the key starts, because the board's resting language is
     now shallow-breath: a solid key starts breathing, a shallow-breathing key breathes
     *deep*. `breath` itself and `rainbow` are the loudest things on the board — motion
     competing with motion gains nothing — and `off` is dark on purpose, so all three
