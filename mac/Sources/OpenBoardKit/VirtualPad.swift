 Decode the bytes a repaint writes, back into what the firmware would show.

 The decoder is the other half of `CodexProtocol.frame` + `requestJSON`, and exists
 for the same reason `--dump` does in the probe: the wire format is the contract, and
 nothing else in the suite could check what `paint()` actually puts on it. It parses
 with `JSONSerialization` rather than mirroring the hand-built field order — the
 firmware's parser is forgiving, the point of the hand-built order is byte-for-byte
 fidelity on the *write* side, and a decoder that only accepted one field order would
 test the encoder's spelling rather than its meaning.

/**
 A pad with no hardware behind it.

 Speaks the vendor channel the way the firmware does — consumes the same framed
 reports, acknowledges each message by echoing its `id`, and emits key events as the
 same JSON lines — so everything above `PadTransport` runs unmodified against it:
 painting, calibration capture, key dispatch, setup. What the firmware would show is
 published through `onFace`, for a window to render.

 Two ways this is *not* the hardware, both deliberate:

 - **It never disappears.** The real pad idles off Bluetooth as a matter of course
   and the app's resident loop exists to cope; the virtual pad is for exercising
   everything else, and a simulated outage would be a feature pretending to be a bug.
 - **Acks are instant** unless `ackLatencyMs` is set. A ring write on hardware
   measures ~86ms, and fun mode's scheduling is built around that — set a latency
   before trusting anything time-shaped.
