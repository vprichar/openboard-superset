/**
 The joystick, which was never inert — it was reporting somewhere nobody looked.

 The pad broadcasts it as `v.oai.rad` ("radial"), not `v.oai.hid`. `KeyEvent.parse`
 accepts only `v.oai.hid` and returns nil for everything else, and the listener then
 dropped nils silently — so every joystick event was discarded before anything could
 see it. Both this project and its Node predecessor concluded the stick "reports
 nothing", on the strength of a capture that was itself filtered to `v.oai.hid`.

 A 30-second capture of the raw stream found 134 events and not one keypress.

 ## What it actually sends

 `{"m":"v.oai.rad","p":{"a":0.234,"d":1}}`

 - `a` — angle around the rim, 0…1 for a full turn
 - `d` — deflection, 0 at rest to 1 at the stop
 - `{a:0, d:0}` is the released reading

 It is **analog**, not four switches: pushing it produces a stream of samples with the
 angle wobbling by a few thousandths, and rolling it round the rim sweeps `a`
 continuously. So a direction is a *decision* about a continuous signal rather than a
 name read off the wire, which is what this type is for.
