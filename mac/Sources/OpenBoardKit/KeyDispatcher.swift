/**
 Turns raw key events into intents.

 Pure and time-injected, so the awkward parts — debounce windows, a keycap that
 reports twice, an encoder that must never be debounced — can be tested without a pad
 or a stopwatch. The side effects live in the app; only the decisions live here.

 The pad broadcasts every press on the vendor channel, which is what lets it stay on
 Layer 1 with Codex's locked keycodes and still mean something to us. Nothing is
 remapped; meaning is assigned here.
