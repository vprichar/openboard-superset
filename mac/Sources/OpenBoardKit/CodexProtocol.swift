/**
 The Codex Micro's private `v.oai.*` HID RPC.

 Undocumented, reverse-engineered, and liable to break on any ChatGPT / Work Louder
 Input / firmware update. Ported from `lib/hid.cjs`, which was in turn vendored from
 pejmanjohn/codex-micro-light (MIT) — see THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md.

 Kept free of IOKit so the framing can be tested without a pad plugged in. The
 transport lives in `HIDDevice.swift`.

 ## Wire format

 A JSON request is chunked across 64-byte output reports:

 ```
 byte 0   report id      0x06
 byte 1   channel        0x02
 byte 2   chunk length   ≤ 61
 bytes 3+ payload
 ```

 Responses arrive the same way and are reassembled by accumulating chunks until the
 buffer parses as JSON. The device acknowledges each write and echoes the method
 back, which is how we know the channel is being read correctly.
