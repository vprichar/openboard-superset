/**
 The board, across restarts.

 Without this, quitting the app forgets which session owns which key. On the next
 launch every session that is still running gets a *different* slot — so the muscle
 memory of "my main project is key 2" is wrong, and the one thing a physical board is
 for is gone.

 ## What is deliberately not trusted on load

 A stored entry is a claim about the world made at some point in the past, and the app
 may have been closed for a week. Every entry is re-validated against the live process
 table before it is allowed back onto the board:

 - a **dead pid** is dropped — its key is free
 - an entry **older than the stale window** is dropped, even if the pid looks alive,
   because pids are reused and a matching one after a reboot is coincidence
 - a **turn in progress** does not survive: `working` from a previous run means a turn
   that can no longer be running
 - a **Superset terminal that is gone** (`disposed`, or with `ended_at`, in Superset's
   own table) makes its session `ended`
 - `awaiting`, `working` and `stalled` come back **unconfirmed**: the claim is kept,
   flagged, and painted as a question until the first live event answers it

`done` and the attention states *are* restored. A completion nobody has been back to is
still unseen, and the app restarting says nothing about whether you saw it.

 Restoring a lie is worse than restoring nothing. The board's whole value is that it
 can be trusted at a glance.

     `done` and the attention states are kept. A completion nobody has been back to is

     relaunched says nothing about either. Wrongly clearing them is the error this board
     must never make, and the stale window already drops anything genuinely old.

     **`working` is asked, not assumed.** It used to settle to `idle`, on the reasoning
     that nothing was happening while the app was closed. That is true of the app and
     false of the session — Claude Code kept running the whole time, and the app is only
     a light — so every session mid-turn during a relaunch came back claiming nothing
     was happening. Its own transcript says which it was, so that is what decides it.

     With no transcript to read, the old behaviour stands. An unanswerable question is
     not a licence to claim a turn is running.
