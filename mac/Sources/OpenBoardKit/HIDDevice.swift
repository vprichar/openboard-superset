/**
 The pad, over IOKit.

 Replaces the Node version's dependency on a `node-hid` prebuild scavenged out of
 ChatGPT.app or Work Louder Input — which worked, but meant the tool silently stopped
 functioning if either app was moved or updated. `IOHIDManager` is the system API and
 has no such dependency.

 ## Finding the vendor collection

 Only the vendor-defined collection (usage page `0xFF00`) speaks the `v.oai.*` RPC.
 Finding it is not what it looks like:

 The pad presents as a **single** `IOHIDDevice` carrying four top-level collections —
 `0x01:6` (keyboard), `0x0C:1`, `0x0C:2` (consumer) and `0xFF00:1` (vendor). Its
 *primary* usage page is `0x01`, so filtering on `kIOHIDPrimaryUsagePageKey` — the
 obvious property, and the one this first used — finds nothing at all.

 The vendor collection has to be located in `kIOHIDDeviceUsagePairsKey` instead, and
 reports are then routed to it by report id (`0x06`) on the one device handle.

 This is also why the counts differ from the Node version's diagnostics: node-hid
 enumerates per-collection and reports four matches with one vendor interface, while
 IOKit reports one device with four collections. Same hardware, different model.

 ## Opening non-exclusively

 `kIOHIDOptionsTypeNone`, deliberately: the ChatGPT app holds this interface open and
 repaints the LEDs on its own schedule. Seizing it would break that app; coexisting
 and re-asserting is the arrangement that works, and is why `HIDWriteLock` exists.

 ## Permissions

 Opening the interface requires **Input Monitoring**, granted per host application,
 and only after that app is restarted. A denial surfaces as `kIOReturnNotPermitted`
 (0xE00002E2), which is mapped to `.accessDenied` so the UI can say what to do rather
 than showing a hex code.

         The obvious reading of `IOHIDDeviceSetReport` is that the id goes in the
         argument and the body goes in the buffer without it. That is what this did,
         and every write succeeded while the pad never changed.

         hidapi — which node-hid uses, and which drives this device correctly — only
         strips the leading byte when the report id is `0x00`. For a numbered report
         like this one (`0x06`) it passes the full buffer *including* the id and sets
         the id argument as well. The firmware evidently expects those 64 bytes.

         It is also symmetric with the read path, where reports arrive with the id
         still in the body — something already discovered here the hard way.
